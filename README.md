These are my highly customized vim configurations.

## Installation
See into ``install.sh`` and you'll hopefully figure out how to install.
That file is more like an instruction, it might not simply work on different machines.

YCM might take some time to install. You can interrupt it by `ctrl-c` if you don't need it.

See ``vimrc`` for details on my configurations.
